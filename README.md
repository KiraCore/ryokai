# Ryokai

## Intro

`Ryokai` is the **new orchestrator tool** from [KiraCore team](https://github.com/KiraCore/).

> `RYOKAI` 了解 (りょかい), previously known as KIRA Manager, is KIRA’s orchestration tool, a physical infrastructure manager
> that facilitates backend operations of KIRA stack components for Consensus nodes. It automates critical processes
> such as [`KiraCore/sekai`](https://github.com/KiraCore/sekai) system upgrades, auto-deployment of containerized Layer 2 applications,
> and [`KiraCore/interx`](https://github.com/KiraCore/interx) configuration.
> The integration with [`hashicorp/vault`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) enhances `RYOKAI`'s capabilities,
> providing robust security features for secrets management and access control.
